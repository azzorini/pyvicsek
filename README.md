# pyvicsek

A Python module for efficient Vicsek simulations.

## About it

This is a Python module made in C++ using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). The standard used to compile the module is C++20. A Makefile is given to compile the module the only two requisites are:

1. Python needs to be installed in the computer. ``python`` and ``python-config`` have to be in the PATH.
2. Pybind11 needs to be installed.

## Vicsek Simulation

This purpose of this module is to be able to run a simulation of the Vicsek model. So let's start by explainig what is the Vicsek model. This model tries to replicate flocks of birds.

So in the model we will have $N$ birds. These birds will move in a box of length $L$. For the simulation periodic boundary conditions are used. Each bird has a radius of vision $r$. Without any loss of generality we set $r=1$. This means that the unit of length is just the radius of vision. All the birds are given the same constant speed $v$. At every time step every single bird will move a distance $v\Delta t$ (where $\Delta t = 1$ fixing now the time units) in whatever direction it is pointing. Then the direction of the bird is also updated. In order to update its direction the bird will try to imitate the average direction of all the birds included in its radius of vision (including itself). But to this average we will add a noise which is just a random number between $\left(-\eta / 2,\ \eta / 2\right)$. Where $\eta$ is another parameter of the model.

A sketch of how a simulation looks is shown in the following image:

We will be able to define and modify all the explained parameters.

Now let's briefly described the mathematical part of the model. At every time step we update the bird $i$ using the following equation:

$$\boldsymbol{x}_i(t+1) = \boldsymbol{x}_i(t) + \boldsymbol{v}_i(t)\Delta t$$

The velocity $\boldsymbol{v}_i$ of the bird is:

$$\boldsymbol{v}_i = v\left[ \hat{\boldsymbol{x}}\cos\theta_i(t) + \hat{\boldsymbol{y}}\sin\theta_i(t)\right]$$

Then the angle is also updated as follows:

$$\theta_i(t+1) = \left\langle \theta(t) \right\rangle_r + \Delta\theta$$

where $\Delta\theta$ is a random number in the interval $\left(-\eta / 2,\ \eta / 2\right)$ and $\left\langle \cdots \right\rangle$ denotes the average over the birds that are at a distance smaller than $r$.
